# PokeAPI React Project

This project is a [Single Page Application (SPA)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SPA) built with [React](https://react.dev/) that interacts with the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to fetch and display data about various Pokémon. The core functionality of this project is based on [AJAX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/AJAX) requests to dynamically retrieve and update Pokémon data without requiring a full page reload. Users can search for specific Pokémon, view detailed information, and navigate through different sections of the app seamlessly.

Key Features:
- Fetch Pokémon data using AJAX requests to the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).
- View detailed information about individual Pokémon.
- Use `await fetch()` function for asynchronous requests.
- React hooks `useState` and `useEffect`.

This project demonstrates the power of combining **React** with **AJAX** to create a responsive and interactive user experience.

### Usage
